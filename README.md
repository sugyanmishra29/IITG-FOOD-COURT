# Features
# 1. Login/Signup
    Username and password are in realtime sync with Firebase database. In the login and signup pages, if any field (username or password)
    is left blank then the user is prompted to enter values in the fields.
# 2. Staying signed in
    User stays signed in even after the app is removed from the device's cache. For signing out, the user has to click on the 3-dot menu on
    the homepage, and then click Sign Out option from the drop-down list and then click on "Sign out" on the pop-up dialog box.

# 3. Shop List Structure
       When the user has signed in, on the home page, there will be a list of shops.Right now, we have made a basic structure for 
       shoplist using RecyclerView and Cardview.
